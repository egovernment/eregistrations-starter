<p>The initial questions help determine what your situation is. Depending on your answers, the system tells you which <strong>registrations</strong> are mandatory and which are optional. The system then indicates the <strong>documents you will need to upload</strong> and the <strong>costs</strong> associated with the registrations you select.</p>

<p>The guide is composed of three sections:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your business registrations</li>
	<li>Required documents</li>
	<li>Costs</li>
</ul>
<p>The guide asks you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Whether you seek to incorporate the company as a Private Limited Company (minimum of 2 subscribers, maximum of 50) or a Public Company.</li>
	<li>Whether your company has share capital (as stated in the memorandum and articles of association). If yes, the guide will ask you for the amount of capital. If not, it will prompt you for the number of subscribers of the company. Both parameters determine Business Registrations and Licensing Agency (BRELA) registration fees. See the fee schedule by clicking <strong>here</strong>.</li>
	<li>How much turnover the company is expected to make in its first year of operations. It is mandatory for a company to register for VAT if its turnover is expected to exceed TZH 40’000’000 a year. However, company management may choose to register the company for VAT even if its turnover is not expected to reach the threshold.</li>
	<li>How many original copies of the registered memorandum and articles of association you wish to obtain (2 is the minimum: one original copy is kept by BRELA, the other copy is given to the company owners. Company representatives may need originals for later administrative needs).</li>
	<li>Whether you lease or own the premises at which business is conducted.</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions are important to determine the fees and the documents you will be required to submit.  At any time, you can change your answers and save your new information.  If you do so, you might be asked to change information in the form before being allowed to submit the application.</p>

<h4 class="page-header mgt-lg" id="registrations">Your business registrations</h4>

<p>To operate legally, your company must be registered with the Business Registrations and Licensing Agency (BRELA) to obtain a certificate of incorporation, with the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) to obtain a Tax Identification Number (TIN) and a VAT certificate if the company’s turnover is expected to exceed TZH 40’000’000 a year.</p>

<p>Your lease must be registered with TRA if it isn’t already. If you have employees, you will have to register the company and your employees with one of the six Social security providers in Tanzania.</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning" id="licences"><strong>NB! Business licenses, coming soon</strong>: the Tanzania Investment Window (TIW) system does not yet allow for the issuance of business licenses delivered by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Business licenses are mandatory to do business in Tanzania and their cost and conditions depend on the Company’s business activity. A company can apply for business licenses once it has been issued with the Certificate of incorporation and TIN numbers (1 and 2 above).</p>
