	<p class="alert alert-warning mgt-md">NB! You will receive an email from TIC, once the documents are ready to be picked up. The documents should be ready after 3 working days after application (min 72 hours).</p>

	<p class="mgt-lg">All originals of the documents that were scanned and uploaded onto the system online, including the original of the signed form, must be submitted to the Front desk Officer at the Tanzania Investment Centre (TIC) in exchange of the company’s certificates of company registration:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Certificate of incorporation (BRELA)</li>
		<li>Registered Memorandum and Articles of Association</li>
		<li>Tax Identification Number registration certificate for the company (TRA)</li>
		<li>Value Added Tax registration certificate (TRA)</li>
		<li>Tax Identification Number registration certificate for the directors (TRA) - provided they do not have a TIN already and that they have undergone biometric registration. The latter can be done minutes prior to picking up the certificates at TIC's One Stop Centre which is equipped with TRA's biometric identification facility.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p class="alert alert-warning mgt-lg"><strong>Important</strong>: at least one of the directors must have a certified individual TIN - meaning that the director has undergone biometric registration - before being authorized to retrieve the Company’s TIN. Therefore, if no Director has a prior certified TIN number, it must be one of the Directors who picks up the certificates and completes the biometric registration upon pickup.</p>

	<p class="mgt-lg">The new company will automatically be registered as a potential employer with the six social security schemes in Tanzania (NSSF, LAPF, GEPF, PSPF, NHIF, PPF). The registration numbers will be available to the company in the system alongside digital copies of registration certificates. No physical certificates are delivered at pickup. The registration number with any of the social security schemes is all proof of registration required when the company whishes to register employees. Social security schemes may choose to send certificates by mail to the user.</p>
