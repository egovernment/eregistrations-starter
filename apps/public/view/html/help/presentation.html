				<h2 class="page-header mgt-md">Starting a Company in Tanzania through the Tanzania Investment Window (TIW) system: what does it involve?</h2>

				<p class="lead mgt-md">The following registrations are required to do business lawfully in Tanzania:</p>

				<h4 class="mgt-md">1. Incorporation</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>a company exists legally in Tanzania once it has been issued with a <strong>Certificate of Incorporation</strong> delivered by the Business Registrations and Licensing Agency (BRELA).</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 class="mgt-md">2. Taxpayer registration</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>Once its legal existence has been established through BRELA, the company must be issued with a <strong>Tax Identification Number</strong> (TIN) from the Tanzania Revenue Authority; if the company’s annual turnover is expected to exceed TZH 40’000’000, it must register for Value Added Tax (VAT) (if expected turnover is less than the TZH 40 million threshold, the company can still request VAT registration).</li>

					<li><strong>All directors within the company must also apply for individual TINs</strong> if they do not already have one. At least one of the directors must have a certified individual TIN - meaning that the director has undergone biometric registration - before being authorized to retrieve the Company’s TIN. Applications for Company and Director TINs, as well as VAT registration, can be done through the Tanzania Investment Window (TIW) system. Biometric registration of the director can be done at the One Stop Centre (OSC) of the Tanzania Investment Centre (TIC) once company certificates are ready to be picked-up. </li>
				</ul>
				<h4 class="mgt-md">3. Employer registration with social security schemes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>A new company will automatically be registered as a potential employer with the six social security schemes in Tanzania (NSSF, LAPF, GEPF, PSPF, NHIF, PPF). This will facilitate hiring future employees who have a legal right to choose the social protection scheme of their liking.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="alert alert-info mgt-lg">All certificates above are available for pick-up at the One Stop Centre (OSC) of the Tanzania Investment Centre (TIC) 3 working days after the application has been submitted online through the TIW system (72 hours).</p>

				<p class="alert alert-warning mgt-lg"><strong>NB! Business licenses are coming soon</strong>: the Tanzania Investment Window (TIW) system does not yet allow for the issuance of business licenses delivered by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Business licenses are mandatory to do business in Tanzania and their cost and conditions depend on the Company’s business activity. A company can apply for business licenses once it has been issued with the Certificate of incorporation and a TIN number (1 and 2 above).</p>
